=head1 NOTES

=head2 App::Prove usage

Both C<prove> and C<prove_cover> use L<App::Prove>. The only difference is this line, added to C<prove_cover>:

 $app->{'exec'} = q{/usr/bin/perl -MDevel::Cover=-db,} . $db_path;

That said, C<prove_cover> should be a drop-in replacement for C<prove>, and work the same way (in the 'running tests' part).

=head2 Devel::Cover usage

Since C<prove_cover> must run all tests under L<Devel::Cover>, ther are run by: C</usr/bin/perl -MDevel::Cover=-db,/foo/bar/cover_db>.
C</foo/bar/cover_db> is the current working directory.

=head2 Devel::CoverReport usage

At this point, there is no way to pass options to L<Devel::CoverReport>. This may change in future release.
Report will be generated as Html output, with all options set at their default values.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

I have observed many times, that when running many tests at once can corrupt Devel::Cover database and thus produce false statistics.

Running with -j 1 (default) should be a safe bet.

=head1 WARNING

Consider this script to be an early ALPHA. It does the job for me, so it's here.

This is my first CPAN module, so I expect that some things may be a bit rough around edges.

The plan is, to fix both those issues, and remove this warning in next immediate release.
